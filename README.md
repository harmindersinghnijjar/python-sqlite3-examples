A repository containing examples implementing Python applications with a SQLite3 database

## Examples

### dark-theme-sqlite3
This Python Eel application allows users to switch between a dark and light theme with the click of a button. The current theme preference is stored in a SQLite database and will be remembered the next time the user opens the application. The application uses the Eel library to create a GUI that consists of a single button for toggling the theme, and a message that displays the current theme preference. The button has an onclick event that calls a JavaScript function to toggle the theme and update the message text. The application uses two separate CSS files to define the styles for the light and dark themes, and these are switched between dynamically using JavaScript. The Python code uses the SQLite library to store the current theme preference in a database file, and retrieve it when the application starts up. The application is designed to be simple and easy to use, with a clean and modern look that can be customized by changing the CSS files.
